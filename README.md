# WYSIWYG-Editor
Ngx Quill inside Angular with Tamil &amp; Sinhala Languages

# Getting started
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I have used npm to manage the dependencies, so i strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from Here, then run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
